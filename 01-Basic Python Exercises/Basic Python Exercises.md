# Basic Python Exercises

These exercises are intended to give some practice with various Python concepts. Use these as a way to practice programming concepts you may not be familiar with, but skip any that you are comfortable or have experience with. Sample output is shown, but your answers may vary.

## Part 1 - Basic Python (Output, Input, Loops, If/Else)

#### 1. Hello World

#### 2. Create a variable called count and set it equal to a number. Then print that variable out. This should be accomplished with [Python f strings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/formatted-string-literals-f-strings-python/).

#### 3. For Loop - Version 1<br>
Write a program to count from 1 to 10 using a for loop, and display the number.

#### 6. While Loop - Version 1<br>
Write a program to count from 1 to 10 using a while loop, and display the number.

#### 7. While Loop - Version 2<br>
Write a program to print all the even numbers from 1 through 10 using a while loop.

#### 8. While Loop - Version 3<br>
Write a program to count from 10 to 1 using a while loop.

#### 10. If/Elif/Else Demo
Generate two random numbers. Compare these numbers to determine if number 1 is greater than 2, number 1 is less than 2, or they are equal.

#### 11. The Collatz Conjecture (3n + 1 problem).
Have the user enter a positive integer.<br>
a.	If that number is even, divide it by 2.<br>
b.	If it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.<br>
c.	Keep applying these same rules to the numbers that result.<br>
d.	Stop when you reach the number 1.<br>
e.	Keep track of the number of steps to get back to 1, and display that information to the user at the end.<br>
If you find a number that doesn’t eventually reach 1, then you have just become a world-famous mathematician. For more information about this problem, watch this video – [The Simplest Math Problem No One Can Solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg)
