# Advanced Python Projects

These projects are intended to be much more open-ended and may require that you do some research and/or read about various Python modules to try these.

1. Create some graphical output with the Python turtle module. Here are some [examples](https://github.com/jbfrc/FRC-Python-Training/blob/main/02-Advanced%20Python%20Projects/Turtle%20Examples.md) of this.
2. Write a text based adventure game in Python. This can be done without object oriented programming (which is the focus of the next section), but you may want to think about how to incorporate OOP into this. Some examples of this are:
   * [Zork I](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork)
   * [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy-42/play-42)
   * [Planetfall](https://www.retrogames.cz/play_1552-DOS.php?language=EN)
3. Develop a game with Pygame.
